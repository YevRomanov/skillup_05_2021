'''Today, Silicon Valley is still the home of the computer industry; 
it is still full of high technology, but it is not the only center for high-tech in the USA.  
Today here are computer firms all over the USA.... and all over the world; 
but Silicon Valley still has the largest concentration of high-tech companies and research centers.'''
